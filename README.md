# maintenance_tracker
NSS Cohort 8 Ruby capstone project

## Project Vision

This will be a small command line program that keeps track of completed and upcoming maintenance for the user's vehicles.

Users will be able to add different cars and the maintenance requirements for those cars. The program will give reminders for what's coming up (or what has been missed) based on the current milage of the car. The user can also get a list of completed and upcoming items.
